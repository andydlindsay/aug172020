# BREAKOUT - Postman

### Postman
* At its heart, Postman is an API client allowing us to send HTTP requests to our servers
* This means that we don't need to build out the front-end to test our back-end functionality

### Installing Postman
* Postman works on all major operating systems
* Download from: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

### The Interface
* HTTP requests can be quickly created using the Postman interface
* Created requests can be saved for later, added to a workspace, and/or shared with teammates

* Beyond the basics, Postman includes a ton of extra features such as:
  * Create documentation for your API
  * Different environments for testing, production, development, etc
  * Automated testing
